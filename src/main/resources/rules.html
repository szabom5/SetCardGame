<h1><b>Instructions</b></h1>
<p>The purpose of the game is to identify a Set of 3 cards from 12 cards placed face up on the table.</p>
<p> Each card has four features, which can vary as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shape</b>: circle, square, triangle</li>
<li><b>Color</b>: red, blue, green</li>
<li><b>Number</b>: one, two, three</li>
<li><b>Shading</b>: solid, striped, outlined</li>
</ul>
<p>A Set consists of 3 cards in which each of the cards’ features, looked at one‐by‐one,
    are the same on each card, or, are  different on  each card.
    All of the features must  separately satisfy this rule.
    In other words: shape must be either the  same on all 3 cards,
    or different on each of the 3 cards;
    color must be either the same on all 3 cards, or different on each of the 3, etc.</p>
