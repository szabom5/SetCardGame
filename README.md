##Brief
SetCardGame is a desktop application for Set, a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 cards varying in four features:
* number
* shape
* shading
* color

Each possible combination of features appears precisely once in the deck.

##What is a set
A set consists of three cards which satisfy all of these conditions:
* They all have the same number, or they have three different numbers.
* They all have the same symbol, or they have three different symbols.
* They all have the same shading, or they have three different shadings.
* They all have the same color, or they have three different colors.

##Rules
In each game the player have to find all sets from the deck of 12 cards.
The more sets you find and the quicker you collect them, the higher your score will be.
Also there is an option for a quick game with a time limit, where you get more cards on your deck, therefore more
possible sets to be found.
